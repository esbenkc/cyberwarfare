# Incentives modeling

We design an iterated multi-agent modified prisoner's dilemma with discount rates over the expectation of opposing powers getting global hegemony due to the develpoment of superintelligence. This is a simulation with US and China as main opposing geopolitical powers.

Expected behaviors of the model:

- Two variables: AI capabilities level of the power and the total payoff for each power
- When one reaches hegemony, the other power will be reduced both in payoff and in AI capabilities due to the full control of the other power
- A drastic action can be taken that reduces your payoff but reduces the opposing power's AI capabilities with the expectation of your high payoffs after global hegemony or after getting better AI capabilities
