## 1) What is the current state of cyberwarfare offense / defense balance?

- [ ] Make a new challenge for offense
  - List of categorized challenges for offense
- [ ] Make a new challenge for defense
  - List of categorized challenges for defense

**Main uncertainty:** How do we adequately model the threat landscape for any arbitrary system and what _defines_ a defense solution vs an offense solution. We can easily make something that simulates identifying a Trojan file but since defense will need to cover every single download on the system, this by default seems to be worse off that attack capabilities, both in price, R&D efforts, and implementation difficulty. Additionally, how do we make a system that naturalistically simulates a system with default security measures implemented.

**Potential solution:** [Wizard of Oz setup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment) to literally act as the naturalistic. Fuzzy results but potential for a naturalistic cyber sandbox environment.

- **Constraint is on scalability:** If we simply run one naturalistic experiment for offense and one for defense, this would somewhat work. We can potentially also delegate this directly to an LLM prompted to be a system and take it from there.

## 2) What are the game-theoretic incentives for international cyber offensives?

## 3) How does the offense / defense balance forecast into the future?

Test on GPT-4, GPT-3, etc. to forecast it from past models to future models.

## 4) How does the ease of cyber offense forecast into the future?

Properties of the parametric model:

- N national cyber attacks
- Incentives (see [2])
- Cost of cyber attacks
- Cyber capabilities forecasting

## 5) What can we do about cyberwarfare destabilization threats?
